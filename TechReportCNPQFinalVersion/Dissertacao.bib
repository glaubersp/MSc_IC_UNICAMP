	Abstract = {Casl is an expressive language for the formal specification of functional
	requirements and modular design of software. It has been designed
	by CoFI, the international Common Framework Initiative for algebraic
	specification and development. It is based on a critical selection
	of features that have already been explored in various contexts,
	including subsorts, partial functions, first-order logic, and structured
	and architectural specifications. Casl should facilitate interoperability
	of many existing algebraic prototyping and verification tools. This
	paper gives an overview of the Casl design. The ma jor issues that
	had to be resolved in the design process are indicated, and all the
	main concepts and constructs of Casl are briefly explained and illustrated---the
	reader is referred to the Casl Language Summary for further details.
	Some familiarity with the fundamental concepts of algebraic specification
	would be advantageous.},

@inproceedings{MaudeLib,
	Abstract = {Maude has a standard library of predefined modules that, by default,
	are entered into the system at the beginning of each session, so
	that any of these predefined modules can be imported by any other
	module defined by the user. Also, by default, the predefined functional
	module BOOL is automatically imported (in including mode) as a submodule
	of any user-defined module, unless such importation is explicitly
	disabled. These modules can be found in the file prelude.maude that
	is part of the Maude distribution.
	
	We describe below those predefined modules that provide commonly used
	data types, including Booleans, numbers, strings, and quoted identifiers.
	The relationships among these modules are shown in the importation
	graph in Figure 9.1, where all the importations are in protecting
	mode.
	
	We also describe typical parameterized collections of data types such
	as lists and sets, and associations such as maps and arrays. The
	chapter ends introducing the built-in linear Diophantine equation
	solver, defined in the file linear.maude that is also part of the
	Maude distribution.
	
	Other predefined modules, also in the prelude.maude file, are discussed
	later; more specifically, the META-LEVEL module is discussed in Chapter
	14, the LOOP-MODE module in Section 17.1, and the CONFIGURATION module
	in Sections 11.1 and 11.4.
	
	Furthermore, this chapter also describes a predefined module MACHINE-INT
	for machine integers, which is obtained from the module INT of (arbitrary
	size) integers, but is distributed in a separate file machine-int.maude.},

@book{CafeOBJReport,
	Abstract = {CafeOBJ is an industrial strength modern algebraic specification language,
	a successor of the famous OBJ language, and directly incorporating
	new paradigms such as behavioural concurrent specification and rewriting
	logic. CafeOBJ is the core of an environment supporting the systems
	(mainly software but not only) development process at several levels,
	including prototyping, specification, and formal verification.
	
	
	This book presents the formal definition of the language and its semantics,
	but also methodologies for specification and verification in CafeOBJ,
	with emphasize on concurrent object composition and modularity.
	
	
	The presentation of the CafeOBJ concepts is supported by many examples,
	and an appendix illustrates the power of the language and its methodologies
	by a larger CASE study including specification, testing, and verification.
	
	
	The book might be used both by software engineers interested in algebraic
	methodologies, and by students and researchers in software engineering
	and/or theoretical computing science as a fast introduction to state-of-the-art
	algebraic specification.},

@article{MLDefIntro,
	Abstract = {Extended ML (EML) is a framework for the formal development of modular
	Standard ML (SML) software systems. Development commences with a
	specification of the behaviour required and proceeds via a sequence
	of partial solutions until a complete solution, an executable SML
	program, is obtained. All stages in this development process are
	expressed in the EML language, an extension of SML with axioms for
	describing properties of module components. This is an overview of
	the formal definition of the EML language. To complement the full
	technical details presented elsewhere, it provides an informal explanation
	of the main ideas, gives the rationale for certain design decisions,
	and outlines some of the technical issues involved. EML is unusual
	in being built around a #real# programming language having a syntax
	and semantics formally defined. Interesting and complex problems
	arise both from the nature of this relationship and from interactions
	between the features of the language.},

@incollection{MossakowskiEtAl07b,
	Abstract = {Heterogeneous specification becomes more and more important because
	complex systems are often specified using multiple viewpoints, involving
	multiple formalisms. Moreover, a formal software development process
	may lead to a change of formalism during the development. However,
	current research in integrated formal methods only deals with ad-hoc
	integrations of different formalisms.
	
	The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is a parsing, static analysis and
	proof management tool combining various such tools for individual
	specification languages, thus providing a tool for heterogeneous
	multi-logic specification. Hets is based on a graph of logics and
	languages (formalized as so-called institutions), their tools, and
	their translations. This provides a clean semantics of heterogeneous
	specifications, as well as a corresponding proof calculus. For proof
	management, the calculus of development graphs (known from other
	large-scale proof management systems) has been adapted to heterogeneous
	specification. Development graphs provide an overview of the (heterogeneous)
	specification module hierarchy and the current proof state, and thus
	may be used for monitoring the overall correctness of a heterogeneous
	development.
	
	We illustrate the approach with a sample heterogeneous proof proving
	the correctness of the composition table of a qualitative spatial
	calculus. The proof involves two different provers and logics: an
	automated first-order prover solving the vast majority of the goals,
	and an interactive higher-order prover used to prove a few bridge
	lemmas.},

	logic. Distinctive features of HasCASL include partial higher order
	functions, higher order subtyping, shallow polymorphism, and an extensive
	type-class mechanism. Moreover, HasCASL provides dedicated specification
	support for monad-based functional-imperative programming with generic
	side effects, including a monad-based generic Hoare logic.},

@unpublished{SchroderEtAl03,
	Abstract = {The development of programs in modern functional languages such as
	Haskell calls for a wide-spectrum specification formalism that supports
	the type system of such languages, in particular higher order types,
	type constructors, and polymorphism, and that contains a functional
	language as an executable subset in order to facilitate rapid prototyping.
	We lay out the design of HasCASL, a higher order extension of CASL
	that is geared towards precisely this purpose. Its semantics is tuned
	to allow program development by specification refinement, while at
	the same time staying close to the set-theoretic semantics of first
	order CASL. The number of primitive concepts in the logic has been
	kept as small as possible; advanced concepts, in particular general
	recursion, can be formulated within the language itself. This document
	provides a detailed definition of the HasCASL syntax and an informal
	description of the semantics, building on the existing CASL Summary.},
